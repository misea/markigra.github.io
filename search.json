    "text": "My Father’s History in Today’s America\n\n\n\nBefore the war\n\n\nMy Dad, who died a few years ago, was a loving, gentle, brilliant man, who had a very tough childhood. His parents separated. The Germans and Russians invaded Poland. He and his family were deported to Kazakhstan. He, his mother and his Uncle eventually ended up in an American-run displaced person’s camp (Americans helped refugees!), and they went to Australia in late 1948. After arriving in Australia as a 16 year-old who had intermittent schooling and little knowledge of English, he was admitted to the University of Melbourne medical school at 19. We moved to the United States when I was a little kid. My Dad overcame a lot of trauma to become the loving man he was, but one thing that he never seemed to shake was being jailed and taken from his parents. It’s a story that needs to be told today.\nIn 1939 my grandparents had already separated and my nearly-seven-year-old Dad was living with my grandmother and her extended family in Janów Poland, now known as Ivano-Frankove, Ukraine. When the Nazis and Soviets invaded Poland, Janów was right next to the agreed border, so close that the Nazis occupied it first, but pulled back to allow the Soviets to take over that area in late September. In April 1940, the Soviet authorities came to my father’s family home and ordered them to be at the train station by midnight. My Dad’s uncles were quick-thinking enough to throw as much food and clothing as they could into duvet covers (suitcases were too small) and they went to the station and were put on a train. My Dad didn’t remember how long they were on the train, but according to other people deported that day it took 11 days to get to to Aktubinsk (now Aktobe) Kazakhstan, where they were to live in a mud hut and work on a sovkhoz – a Soviet state-owned farm.\nMy grandfather was not pleased to have his only child shipped off to some godforsaken province of Stalin’s empire and went to take my dad back to his family home in Lwów. That’s why my father and grandfather were on a train when the NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, arrested them for traveling without the correct papers. For good measure they arrested my grandmother too. The NKVD was thorough in its cruelty.\nMy father was taken from his parents and put in a juvenile jail. He was told he might not see his parents again. The older kids in the jail beat him because he was a Jew, or because they could, or both. They stole his shoes. My father was so shaken and distraught he wet the bed. The jailers took his mattress. My grandmother, for her part, was tortured with sleep deprivation and faced the terrifying prospect that she had lost her only child. After some weeks she agreed to work for the NKVD, translating letters from Yiddish into Russian, and they let her have her son back.\nMy father used to tell us stories about the absurdities of life in the Soviet Union. The first day of school when all of the students had to paste over the picture of General Tukhachevsky in their history books – the former hero had become a non-person. The bedbugs that were so numerous they used to pour boiling water down the bedpost to try to kill them. The threat of starvation – grain left the Soviet farm, but no food came back. People could get lost in a snowstorm on the way to the outhouse and not be found until Spring. Animal dung was such a valuable commodity for cooking and heating that “the richest person was the one with the biggest pile of shit outside his house.” About all of that, he could shake his head and laugh. But he was forever haunted by being taken from his parents. Of everything, for my Dad, those were the true hard times.\nThe great irony here is that my dad became a Republican voter – he was deeply affected by the behavior of a too-powerful government and thought that if you kept government small it wouldn’t be able to oppress you. If you ask me, the dangers posed by government do not come from taxing people so you can send Social Security checks or pay doctors; they come from people’s willingness to use cruelty to get what they want – a power available to governments of all sizes. Of course my Dad was a National Review/PBS Newshour Republican, not a Fox News one, and he would have opposed Trump just as he opposed Nixon – he abhorred deliberate cruelty and could smell a lying demagogue a mile off.\nMy father would be particularly shaken by the direct line from the people who imprisoned my him to the people perpetrating America’s current nightmare. The NKVD became the KGB which trained Vladimir Putin and morphed into the GRU – you know, the folks who helped elect Donald Trump. If you hear that taking children from their parents because they don’t have the right immigration papers is a Stalinist tactic, that’s because it is exactly a Stalinist tactic. Trump is copying Stalin, but America is not yet Soviet Union. My Dad couldn’t fight back against the people who took him from his parents then. We can fight back against the people who are doing this to children now."

    "text": "As I move out of the software & start my PhD, I wanted to do some online boasting about the best software effort I was ever involved with. From 1999 to 2001, Westside.com built a platform as a service that anticipated many of the software trends of the last 10 years. I’d still argue that there is still nothing that combines the features of Westside in such an integrated way.\n\n\n\nYounger Days\n\n\nThey were repping our website, right?\nWe named the company Westside because we were all tired of commuting to Microsoft’s offices on the Eastside. We were also clueless white guys who had never heard of the gangsta rap supergroup Westside Connection . This caused some consternation when we turned on the westside.com domain and immediately got an email saying that we should give up the domain. If we did not, the sender would “come over and put a cap in your ass.” We’re pretty sure the mail was sent by some Scandanavian fanboy. In any case, our asses remained capless.\nOur goal at Westside was to build a cloud-native development platform for building the kind of business apps that had been built on top of Microsoft Access, Lotus Notes and Powerbuilder in the 90s, but optimized for the web. The development environment had to run in a browser, and we were trying to do this before the cloud existed as we know it. Our team ended up having to build just about everything from scratch. Why was Westside great? It was incredibly easy to build a data-driven web app with a full relational schema, deeply integrated user model and security, and a web interface that had built in support for displaying and editing relational data on line.\nIt was an exciting and invigorating time. During those two years, we built a team, built out an office and built a product. Brendan and I both had our first kids. George got married. We struggled with finances, the market, and people spending too much time playing video games. But we always thought we were building a pretty exciting product.\nWe did build this really cool product, but none of the founders knew anything about sales and marketing. We didn’t understand how hard it was to reach our potential customers, and having reached them, convince them to trust us with their data. Without deep pockets and a trusted brand, we couldn’t reach the broad base of users we needed. George had recruited the fantastic Paul Maritz to be the chairman of our board, but even so, when the dotcom boom busted we couldn’t get the money to enlarge our customer base. Instead we sold Westside to BEA Systems, an enterprise software company that was later acquired by Oracle. Our former marketing director convinced BEA to spin off Westside and he ran an essentially unchanged version as dataweb.com for years. It still kind-of-works, but bit-rot and browser changes seem to have made it unstable since 2014 or so. Still it was good enough that LabKey used a custom Westside app for time tracking until just a few years ago.\nSelling to BEA was a mistake. We chose BEA over a lowball offer from this little startup in San Francisco, run by a guy named Mark Benioff, who told George & I that he was going to think about the sale while “swimming with the dolphins in Hawaii.” Salesforce is now a leading provider of web development tools, has a $64 Billion market cap and is building a tower in San Francisco. BEA is a footnote. Oh well…\nAnyway, many thanks to Adam, Brendan, Brian, Britt, Carrie, Delight, Derrick, Ed, Geoffrey, George, Heather, Jax, Jill, Jim, Joe, Joel, John, Kay, Mary, Matt, Michael, Neil, Nick, Paul, Peter, Rick, Ryan, Scott, Tamra, Tim, Tom and several people I know I missed in this list. We did great work together.\n\n\nFor the irrideemably nerdy folks, here’s a little overview of Westside.com. Remember, this was all written 16 or 17 years ago, when the best web browser on the planet was Internet Explorer 5, and Firefox 1.0 was still a few years in the future.\nWestside had a React-like view engine, with web components, a drag-n-drop graphical designer, 2-way editing and autocomplete, mostly built by the brilliant Nick Shulman.\n\n\n\nEdit View\n\n\nView code looked something like this. As with React, components were declared with XML and had custom properties. As with react, custom properties could be assigned with embedded code, as with #User.name# in the filter clause below.\n    &lt;ws:dataregion defaultmode=\"grid\"  newrecordposition=\"bottom\" &gt;\n      &lt;ws:datasource filter=\"OwnedBy=#User.name#\" src=\"Customers\" /&gt; \n      &lt;ws:caption&gt;Customers&lt;/ws:caption&gt;\n      &lt;ws:fieldbox&gt;\n         &lt;ws:field name=\"FirstName\"&gt;\n              &lt;ws:caption&gt;First Name&lt;/ws:caption&gt;\n         &lt;/ws:field&gt;\n         ...\n       &lt;/ws:fieldbox&gt;\n      &lt;ws:actionbar class=\"ws-actionbar\"&gt;\n        &lt;ws:action displaytype=\"image\" displaymodes=\"insert,update\" type=\"submit\" /&gt;\n        &lt;ws:action displaytype=\"image\" displaymodes=\"details\" type=\"showupdatepage\" displayrole=\"author\" /&gt;\n        ...\n      &lt;/ws:actionbar&gt;\n    &lt;/ws:dataregion&gt;\nThe web-based code editor supported auto-complete for properties, built-in objects and table fields.\nIt was easy to create tables, including tables with “lookups”, which are just foreign keys.\n\n\n\nCreate Table\n\n\nThe view designer could use lookups to join in related data without writing SQL. The user picked fields from a list and the data layer would automatically generate SQL joins when you used field names like ‘customer:Address’. You could also nest data regions, so you could, for example, show Orders under a Customer record and Items under each order, all without writing any code.\nSecurity was deeply embedded through the system, with automatic support for user management, groups and even row-level permissions. View components could selectively render based on user permissions.\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nThe SQL layer, led by Matt, supported all the security, grouping, including shortcuts to join grouped data with other tables. It also did caching transparently for developers. The backend database was SQL Server, but that was not visible to the end user.\nThe Javascript engine (which John Burroughs had to build because there wasn’t an open source one) supported HTML embedded in Javascript and vice-versa. You could also use Javascript to write database triggers\n\n\n\nTrigger\n\n\nand drop-dead simple web services.\nwebcall function hello(name) {\n    return \"Hello \" + name;\n}\nBy default, all code ran with the permissions (including data access) or the user making a request. If a function needed to do something that the calling user couldn’t do, a developer could get it to run under a higher permission level using another annotation.\nasAdmin function doDangerousThing(value1, value2) {\n    Table.insert(\"SecretTable\", {field1:value1, field2:value2})\n}\nA rich server-side object model included the standard request/response infrastructure plus access to the data layer, user information and server-side http-client for tying web services together.\nDevelopers could build and share modules that exposed new web components that were fully supported in the designer. One of the coolest things was the modules could also include a full data model, so you could just drop in something like a fully working blog.\nWestside included full text search over relational tables using search engine code licensed from AltaVista, and a cool configuration UI built by Tamra Myers.\nPeter made sure that Westside webs could be deployed and redeployed with a packaging technology that allowed you to move data & code back and forth betweeen production and development versions. You could also just download the whole web (including data) as a zip file, or export all the tables to an Access database.\nBecause there was no good web-testing system, I prototyped a cross-frame system, which Brendan blew up into a full-fledged selenium-like test framework supported by the server infrastructure.\nBrian, with Joe & Ryan’s help, made all this run on servers that he personally installed in a cage at a data center. I think he also had to move them when the data center company went bankrupt.\nI would be very happy if someone built a version of Westside using all the modern web technologies. There are so many off-the-shelf components from Node, React and web-based code editors to full text engines like ElasticSearch, that it shouldn’t be too terribly challenging to build a facsimile. Getting the designer, data and security models right is the tricky bit, but I’m sure it can be done. If you decide to do it, let me know; I’ll happily become a customer."

    "text": "Inside Westside (for geeks only)\nFor the irredeemably nerdy folks, here’s a little overview of Westside.com. Remember, this was all written 16 or 17 years ago, when the best web browser on the planet was Internet Explorer 5, and Firefox 1.0 was still a few years in the future.\nWestside had a React-like view engine, with web components, a drag-n-drop graphical designer, 2-way editing and autocomplete, mostly built by the brilliant Nick Shulman.\n\n\n\nEdit View\n\n\nView code looked something like this. As with React, components were declared with XML and had custom properties. As with react, custom properties could be assigned with embedded code, as with #User.name# in the filter clause below.\n    &lt;ws:dataregion defaultmode=\"grid\"  newrecordposition=\"bottom\" &gt;\n      &lt;ws:datasource filter=\"OwnedBy=#User.name#\" src=\"Customers\" /&gt; \n      &lt;ws:caption&gt;Customers&lt;/ws:caption&gt;\n      &lt;ws:fieldbox&gt;\n         &lt;ws:field name=\"FirstName\"&gt;\n              &lt;ws:caption&gt;First Name&lt;/ws:caption&gt;\n         &lt;/ws:field&gt;\n         ...\n       &lt;/ws:fieldbox&gt;\n      &lt;ws:actionbar class=\"ws-actionbar\"&gt;\n        &lt;ws:action displaytype=\"image\" displaymodes=\"insert,update\" type=\"submit\" /&gt;\n        &lt;ws:action displaytype=\"image\" displaymodes=\"details\" type=\"showupdatepage\" displayrole=\"author\" /&gt;\n        ...\n      &lt;/ws:actionbar&gt;\n    &lt;/ws:dataregion&gt;\nThe web-based code editor supported auto-complete for properties, built-in objects and table fields.\nIt was easy to create tables, including tables with “lookups”, which are just foreign keys.\n\n\n\nCreate Table\n\n\nThe view designer could use lookups to join in related data without writing SQL. The user picked fields from a list and the data layer would automatically generate SQL joins when you used field names like ‘customer:Address’. You could also nest data regions, so you could, for example, show Orders under a Customer record and Items under each order, all without writing any code.\nSecurity was deeply embedded through the system, with automatic support for user management, groups and even row-level permissions. View components could selectively render based on user permissions.\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nThe SQL layer, built primarily by Matt, supported security, managed built in fields, and made grouping easy, including shortcuts to join grouped data with other tables. It also did caching transparently for developers. The backend database was SQL Server, but that was not visible to the end user.\nThe Javascript engine (which John Burroughs had to build because there wasn’t an open source one) supported HTML embedded in Javascript and vice-versa. You could also use Javascript to write database triggers\n\n\n\nTrigger\n\n\nand drop-dead simple web services.\nwebcall function hello(name) {\n    return \"Hello \" + name;\n}\nBy default, all code ran with the permissions (including data access) of the user making a request. If a function needed to do something that the calling user couldn’t do, a developer could get it to run under a higher permission level using another annotation.\nasAdmin function doDangerousThing(value1, value2) {\n    Table.insert(\"SecretTable\", {field1:value1, field2:value2})\n}\nA rich server-side object model included the standard request/response infrastructure plus access to the data layer, user information and server-side http-client for tying web services together.\nDevelopers could build and share modules that exposed new web components that were fully supported in the designer. One of the coolest things was the modules could also include a full data model, so you could just drop in something like a fully working blog.\nWestside included full text search over relational tables using search engine code licensed from AltaVista, and a cool configuration UI built by Tamra Myers.\nPeter made sure that Westside webs could be deployed and redeployed with a packaging technology that allowed you to move data & code back and forth betweeen production and development versions. You could also just download the whole web (including data) as a zip file, or export all the tables to an Access database.\nBecause there was no good web-testing system, I prototyped a cross-frame system, which Brendan blew up into a full-fledged selenium-like test framework supported by the server infrastructure.\nBrian, with Joe & Ryan’s help, made all this run on servers that he personally installed in a cage at a data center. I think he also had to move them when the data center company went bankrupt.\nI would be very happy if someone built a version of Westside using all the modern web technologies. There are so many off-the-shelf components from Node, React and web-based code editors to full text engines like ElasticSearch, that it shouldn’t be too terribly challenging to build a facsimile. Getting the designer, data and security models right is the tricky bit, but I’m sure it can be done. If you decide to do it, let me know; I’ll happily become a customer."

    "text": "I spent four days this week as a chaperone for 75 5th graders at Camp Islandwood, where in an incessant Northwest rain we learned about the food cycle, the water cycle, and that “breathable waterproof” fabric is a cruel marketer’s joke. I was at the camp as a general chaperone, but especially to keep an eye on my son Alex who has been in the Autism Inclusion program at John Hay, our local public school, since Kindergarten.\nI was saddened to see that despite his personal growth and success in a classroom full of typical peers Alex was still a far outlier in the group. Perhaps due to the unfamiliar environment and lack of routine Alex was often in his own world – thinking his own thoughts and frequently “stimming” by humming or making strange hand motions. The kids clearly liked Alex; they talked to him, included him in games and treated him with respect. But he was too quirky and not quick or engaged enough to keep up with their social interactions.\nDuring the days Alex was part of a field group with 7 girls and 3 other boys who Alex describes as “awesome.” Awesome is a term he defines precisely as being popular and good at sports; traits Alex fervently wishes he had. On hikes these boys established their awesomeness by trying to push each other in the abundant mud or spit backwards over their own heads with consequences variously for the person behind you, your backpack, or your own head.\nOn the third day our group participated in a team challenge course, where the team has to work together to overcome a physical obstacle. The tasks must seem daunting if, like Alex, you have trouble with social interaction, are uncoordinated and are anxious about your disabilities.\nThe first challenge was to cross a “lava pit”. In the middle of the pit was a platform – the challenge was to get all of the kids onto the platform at the same time without touching the lava. The only tool was a rope swing that hung halfway across the pit, beyond the reach of even the tallest student. The group wisely rejected Alex’s proposal of throwing the smallest student at the swing and instead held a tall boy’s free hand while he teetered out over the “lava”, grabbed the rope and swung himself across.\n\nOne after another the kids put a knee in the loop (knees only, by the safety rule), swung themselves across and pushed the swing back. A few, including Alex, fell into the lava on the way over and had to try again. By the second try everyone was on the platform. Everyone except Alex, who before his second attempt was already near tears and shaking with nervousness. After his second fall, Alex melted down. The other kids were all standing on the platform and Alex started crying and blaming anything but himself. “You told me my knee was in the loop. It’s all about the knee!” The camp guide tried to explain how to grab the rope, but Alex was panicked and inconsolable. He turned to me, but wouldn’t listen, breathing hard, tears running down his face and repeating nonsense. “It’s all about the knee. You told me my knee was in the loop!”\nThat’s when his classmates stepped in. They walked off the platform and crossed the lava pit. First a girl who told him “It’s OK, I fell too”. In a second another girl and two of the boys came to help. Four kids huddled around him, telling him everything was OK, showing him where to hold the rope and how to put his knee in the loop. They pushed him across the gap where his teammates grabbed him and unloaded him onto the platform. In a minute they had all swung across to the platform and with Alex still sniffling, claimed success.\nThey did this without eye rolling, without judging or complaining, and certainly without teasing. They did it naturally and with no expectation of praise or reward. Kids who were pushing each other in the mud and laughing about it saw someone in need and came to the rescue. It was no big deal to them. Alex was still embarrassed about his performance, but the kids said, “it was fine Alex, we did great.” The other chaperone and I were near tears to see children being so selfless and admirable, so casually and naturally. They did great - the guide said they were one of the fastest teams he had seen.\nI have known for a long time that inclusion in a regular classroom is the best educational option for someone like Alex. There is a complex language of social interaction and like any other language, it’s impossible to learn without being immersed in it. I have also believed that there is a benefit to his classmates, who despite the limited ethnic & cultural diversity in our neighborhood would at least benefit from seeing some neurodiversity. But unless kids have evolved since I was in 5th grade, these kids also learned something else at school and at home. They grew up with someone different and knew well what he needed. And they knew they could provide it. They learned tolerance, empathy and confidence that they could help those in need.\nWill the skills of tolerance and empathy help these kids in their academic life? Maybe not. Will they help them in the business world? I’ve dealt with enough CEOs to know that these are not requirements for the job. But if we are trying, as parents and teachers, to grow menschen, people of integrity and honor, then I saw some wonderful evidence of success. So I want to thank John Hay – the teachers and parents and especially the children.  You are awesome, not just by Alex’s definition, but by mine."
